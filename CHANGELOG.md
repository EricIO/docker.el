# Changelog
Changes to the project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

For each released version a line starting with ```## [major.minor.patch]``` will appear.
Below that is a release date followed but sections for what was added, removed and changed.

The versioning of docker.el is x.y.z where X is the major version, y is the minor version and z
is the patch version. The versioning starts a 0.0.0.

The major version is only changed when we will brake something user facing. The exception
to this will be during the 0.y.z phase where the software will not be considered stable and brakes
may occur, these will be well documented.

The minor version will change when new features are added in a backwards compatible way.

The patch version will change when bug fixes are added in a backwards compatible way.
